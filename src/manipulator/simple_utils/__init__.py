"""
This sub-package contains many simple utilities.
By design, this package should NOT import any functions from other packages in manipulator.
Multiple-processing codes can load this package as the load time of this package is designed to be short.

One should consider put functions in this package if:
- it does not depend on any other packages in manipulator
- it does not use un-common third-party packages that requires long load time
